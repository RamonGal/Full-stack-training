# Full-stack-training
This repository is aimed at documenting my learning of full stack development and the different tools I go through.

The initial projetct is a boostrap reasponsive website whose UI follows the course's directives, at the end I'll try to make it look better, so as of now, disregard the interface design, and only judge the utils. ðŸ‘½
