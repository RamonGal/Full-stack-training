# Full-stack-training
This repository is aimed at documenting my learning of full stack development and the different tools I go through. 🐺

The initial project is a bootstrap responsive website whose UI is limited by a course's directive, so the interface design was an improvement on what I was given, so try to judge based on the utils used. 👽

The following project is a React based front-end application that is followed by a server side system using MongoDB/Express/NodeJS, which I'll then try and finish off with a complete containerization using Docker. 🧛
